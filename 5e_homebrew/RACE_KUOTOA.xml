      <p class="flavor">Haunted by an ancient crime that robbed them of their wings, the kenku wander the world as vagabonds and burglars who live at the edge of human society. Kenku suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly unearned, but they can prove to be valuable allies.</p>
      <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>A kuo-toa superficially resemble a grotesque cross between a fish and a humanoid. Their stout, stocky bodies are covered in slippery blue or purple scales, with clawed, webbed feet and black nails. Their hands are much more human-like, ending in the blunt nails typical of most humanoid races. Where one would normally expect the neck of a humanoid to be, there is instead the head of a fish, placed as if it had been grafted on. Some kuo-toa will display whiskers similar to those of a catfish, others have fins at the sides or tops of their heads, and a few have a mixture of both. Their bulging eyes are always a sickly yellow color, with a massive black pupil in the center.</p>

      <h4>HISTORY</h4>
      <p>In days long past, kuo-toa once dwelled on the shores and islands of the surface world. The kuo-toa were driven deep underground by the humans and their ilk, dooming them to spend eternity in darkness. In their prison of the Underdark, the kuo-toa came into contact with the illithid, and found themselves a new set of oppressors. The illithid subjected the kuo-toa to slavery, condemning thousands to lives as chattel. The kuo-toa were a simple race, and were never intended to bear through the mental strain the illithids' psychic energy placed upon them. Nearly every kuo-toa was driven hopelessly mad and paranoid, and they retain their madness, even long after the mind flayers abandoned them. They invent their own gods in their madness, in a vain effort to protect themselves from the threats they face in their dangerous home.</p>

      <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
      <p>Kuo-toa revere deities of their own design. Though their gods are not real, if enough kuo-toa fervently believe in a deity, their subconcious minds have a strange way of combining their power and manifesting that deity as a physical entity. Among the most revered kuo-toa gods are Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, a female human with a crayfish head, claws, and shell covering her shoulders. Archpriests hold among the highest positions in kuo-toa society, being surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. Archpriests' devotion to their deity is so fervent that they manifest divine powers similar to a cleric. Archpriests also have the power to bestow a fraction of their mystical powers to particularly loyal underlings known as whips, who fight to the death to become the archpriest's heir when the archpriest succumbs. A disloyal whip may be stripped of its powers, if not its life. Most other humanoid societies view the kuo-toas' strange ways with disdain, chief among them being the Drow, who have slain the kuo-toa on sight as long as the two races have known each other.</p>

      <h4>KUO-TOA NAMES</h4>
      <p>Kuo-toa names are either stolen from other cultures or pulled from the dark depths of their insane minds, providing little deep meaning.</p>
      <p>Male Names: Flip, Trent, Trajor, JolJom, Shuushar, Ploopploopeen, Glooglugogg</p>
      <p>Female Names: Sally, Feminis, Sardini, Bloppblippodd</p>
