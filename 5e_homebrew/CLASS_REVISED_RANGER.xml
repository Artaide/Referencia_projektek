		<description>
			<p class="flavor">A warrior who uses martial prowess and nature magic to combat threats on the edges of civilization.</p>			
			<p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
			<p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
			<p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
			<p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
			<h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
			<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
			<h4>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</h4>
			<p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
			<p class="indent">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
			<p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your Examine Enemy and Environment? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
			<p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, you can spend a short rest examining a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">By the end of a short rest you determine the type of the creature, along with its resistances/immunities, vulnerabilites, which saving throws it's proficient in if any, its senses, condition immunities and challenge rating.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track down or recall information about the examined creature. Spending 5 short rests on examining 5 different creatures of the same type grants you advantage on checks made to track down and recall information about any creature of that type.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also from 1st level onward, you can spend 1 day of downtime exploring a type of natural environment, be it arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp or the Underdark. After a day of inspecting the environment, you can't get lost and are no longer affected by natural difficult terrain in that type of environment, and neither is your group while they travel with you.</p>
			<p class="indent">While in familiar territory, you can't be surprised even when engaged in activities such as foraging, navigating or tracking, and traveling alone lets you move stealthily at a normal pace, and while tracking other creatures, you learn their exact number, their sizes and how long ago they passe through the area.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can cast Hunter's Mark on a creature of your choice without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per long rest. You always cast this spell at the highest available level when using this feature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once per short rest, if you roll for initiative and you can't cast Hunter's Mark this way, you can do so once in that combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beginning at 5th level, you can cast the Locate Animals or Plants spell twice per long rest without expending a spell slot.</p>

	<element name="Fighting Style" type="Class Feature" source="Axel's Homebrew Collected from Many Places" id="ID_CUSTOM_CLASSFEATURE_RANGER_FIGHTING_STYLE">
		<description>
			<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">ARCHERY</h5>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">[WIP]BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover. even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">DEFENSE</h5>
			<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">[WIP]DRUIDIC WARRIOR</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spell for you, and Wisdom is you spellcasting ability modifier for them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace on of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">DUELING</h5>
			<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">[WIP]THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as a part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a + 2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
			<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>

		<description>
			<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nautre to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *animal friendship* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *animal friendship* using either slot.</p>
			<h5>PREPARING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>After finishing a long rest, you prepare a list of spells available to you. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your Ranger level (rounded down, minimum of one spell). These spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

			<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can spend a 3rd or higher level spell slot to draw on the powers of nature to hide yourself or a willing creature from view briefly. As a bonus action, you can magically make the creature and all of its equipment invisible for 1 minute.</p>

			Once camouflaged in this way, a creature can try to hide by pressing itself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as they are. The creature gains a +10 bonus to Stealth checks as long as they remain there without moving or taking actions. The bonus decreases to a +5 when the camouflaged creature moves at a pace of 5 feet per turn, and lost if it moves any faster.</description>

You also determine the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.</p>

It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action. If you are incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
