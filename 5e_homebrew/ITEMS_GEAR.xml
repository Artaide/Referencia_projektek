		<description>
			<p>This sticky, adhesive fluid freezes its surroundings when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's frost as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls while frozen this way. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to shake the frost off of themselves.</p>
